This tutorial will help you master Commerce block customizations while learning how to build an Edge Delivery Services storefront.

Dropins are full-featured shopping components that turn websites into storefronts. They are not the primitive components, like the Carousels and Galleries used within them. For example, our Product Details, Checkout, and Cart dropins are featured as full pages out of the box to create the entire storefront shopping experience for a website. Our dropins can also support different layouts for different purposes. For example, our MiniCart is simply a Cart with compact layout typical of MiniCarts so that they can be added to Popover or Panel components.

## Dropins are the building blocks of our storefronts

you will learn how to build storefronts using the new Edge Delivery Services for Adobe Commerce. With Edge Delivery you get both speed and agility to build the fastest shops on the web. And with the Adobe Commerce boilerplate, you get all our available dropin components —pre-integrated— to kickstart your storefront development. Edge Delivery's intuitive authoring capabilities also let you experiment with highly personalized experiences and enrich your storefront content quickly.

Dropin components (along with Commerce services) make up the entire storefront experience. They are equivalent to small apps that you can mix and match to create a storefront that fits your needs.

## Framework Agnostic

Our dropin components easily integrate into the most popular frontend frameworks, or into no framework at all! Here are a few of them:

<Tasks>

1. **React** — For when you want to use—or already use—the most popular frontend framework for your storefront.

1. **Vue** — For when you know and love Vue for its simplicity, flexibility and performance.

1. **Vanilla web** — For when HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all you want.

1. **Edge Delivery Services** — (highly recommended!) For when you need amazing speed from a performance-first architecture; built-in analytics; real user monitoring (RUM); parallel authoring, development, and design for fast development cycles; and a storefront boilerplate pre-configured with all our Commerce components and services. Popular? Not yet. Biased? Yes, and for good reason!
