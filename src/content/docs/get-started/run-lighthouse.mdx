PageSpeed Insights is the most accurate way to audit your storefront's Web Vitals. It uses the same Lighthouse engine as the Chrome DevTools, but it runs the audit on a real device in a controlled environment.

Visit the Adobe Experience Manager docs topic, [Keeping it 100](https://www.aem.live/developer/keeping-it-100) ðŸ’¯, to learn more about what PageSpeed Insights measure and how to keep your storefront at 100.

## Step-by-step

<Steps>

1. Navigate to the PageSpeed Insights page: https://pagespeed.web.dev/.
1. Enter your `.live` storefront URL. The URLs for your preview and live sites take the following forms:

   - **Preview**: `https://main--{repo}--{owner}.hlx.page/`
   - **Live**: `https://main--{repo}--{owner}.hlx.live/`

1. Click the **Analyze** button to run the audit.
1. You should see full Web Vital reports for both mobile and desktop, with lighthouse scores at or very near 100 across Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO. ðŸš€
