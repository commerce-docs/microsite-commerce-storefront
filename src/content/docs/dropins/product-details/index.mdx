The Product Details Page (PDP) dropin renders detailed information about your products, including descriptions, specifications, options, pricing, and images.

The practical application of rendering different product types is to provide a consistent user experience across different products. For example, a simple product can be rendered with a single price and quantity, while a complex product can be rendered with multiple simple products and different prices. This flexibility allows you to showcase a wide range of products in a consistent and user-friendly manner. These product types allow you to cater to diverse customer needs, streamline operations, and enhance the shopping experience.

## Use cases

The PDP dropin provides a variety of fully-customizable controls to showcase your products according to your brand's aesthetics and build interactive experiences that engage customers. Use cases include:

- **Image Carousel**: Display multiple product images in a carousel format, allowing users to view different angles and details of the product.
- **Product Information**: Showcase detailed product information, including pricing, descriptions, and specifications.
- **Product Variants**: Display different product variants, such as colors, sizes, and styles, allowing users to select the option that best fits their needs.
- **Product Reviews**: Include user reviews and ratings to provide social proof and help users make informed purchasing decisions.
- **Customization Options**: Customize the appearance and behavior of the dropin to align with your brand's design aesthetic and user experience goals.

## Render product types

The PDP dropin supports rendering different product types configured in your Adobe Commerce instance by default using data provided by the [Catalog Service GraphQL API](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/services/graphql/catalog-service/). Adobe Commerce supports seven product types, but the Catalog Service GraphQL API schema maps these to two types:

- _Simple products_ are products that are defined with a single price and quantity. Catalog Service maps the simple, virtual, downloadable, and gift card product types to [`simpleProductViews`](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/services/graphql/catalog-service/products/#return-details-about-a-simple-product).
- _Complex products_ are comprised of multiple simple products. The component simple products can have different prices. A complex product can also be defined so that the shopper can specify the quantity of component simple products. Catalog Service maps the configurable, bundle, and grouped product types to [`complexProductViews`](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/services/graphql/catalog-service/products/#return-details-about-a-complex-product).
