The CSS classes for each UI component that provides the Cart dropin with its UI are provided here. Override these classes and add new classes to customize the look and feel of your Cart dropin to match your specific style requirements.

:::tip[Boilerplate CSS Tip!]
Cart contains several components that provide its UI. If you plan to make several CSS changes to the dropin, we suggest creating CSS files for each dropin component (in the `cart` directory) and importing those into the `cart.css` file as shown below. This practice makes it easier to maintain and update your CSS in the future.

```css title="cart.css"
@import 'cart.css';
@import 'empty-cart.css';
@import 'mini-cart.css';
```

## Customizing your Cart styles

The quickest way to override Cart CSS is to inspect the Cart UI from your browser's developer tools.

1. **Inspect the element** in the UI that you want to customize (right-click on the element and select "Inspect" from the menu).
1. **Identify the CSS class(es)** for the element. We use [BEM naming](https://getbem.com/naming/), which makes it easy to know which component you're changing (and which CSS file to use). This class styles the `Cart` component, so use your `cart.css` file.
1. **Copy the CSS class** to your `cart.css` file to override the existing rules or add new rules to the class. But wait! Look closely 🧐 at the `.cart-cart__heading` class. It's using two **design tokens**. And when you see a design token within a CSS rule, don't remove the token. Instead, change the token's value (where it's defined) OR create a new token along-side this existing one to ensure maintenance and updates continue to benefit from global design token usage.

## Example CSS overrides

Here's an example of adding CSS class overrides to your `cart.css` file:

```css title="cart.css"
.cart-cart__heading {
  color: var(--color-positive-800);
}

.cart-empty-cart__wrapper {
  text-align: center;
}

.cart-mini-cart__footer {
  row-gap: var(--spacing-small);
}
```

## Cart Component CSS

The CSS classes for each Cart Component are provided here.

<CodeImport code={cart} title="cart.css" lang="css" frame="none" />

<CodeImport code={emptyCart} title="empty-cart.css" lang="css" frame="none" />

<CodeImport code={miniCart} title="mini-cart.css" lang="css" frame="none" />

## Summary

You can customize the Cart dropin by overriding the CSS classes provided for each component. Create a CSS file for each component to make it easier to maintain and update your Cart CSS. Use the BEM naming convention and your browser's dev tools to identify and copy the class to your corresponding component CSS file and override it as needed. Happy styling! 🎨
