Design tokens are the quickest way to customize your storefront. By changing the default token values with your own brand colors, typography, spacing, and shapes, you can make quick, global brand changes to your entire storefront.

## CSS classes

CSS classes provide deeper style changes for dropins than design tokens. Overriding or adding new CSS classes allows you to restyle specific areas of the dropin You'll find best practices for styling here.

## Slots

Slots provide the deepest level of customization. Slots are built-in extension points in the dropin to add your own UI components and functions. You'll learn how powerful slots can be.
