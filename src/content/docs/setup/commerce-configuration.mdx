In this section, you'll learn how Commerce blocks in your storefront connect to a Commerce backend using values from the `configs.xlsx` in the root of your SharePoint content directory.

In the [Create your storefront tutorial](/get-started/), the sample content archive provided you with a `configs.xlsx` file in the root folder. This file is used to expose Adobe Commerce configuration parameters to the frontend blocks.

When implementing your own project, you must update the configuration values with:

* The Catalog Service header values specific to your Adobe Commerce backend.

* The configuration values with the core Adobe Commerce GraphQL endpoint that you configured as part of the [content delivery network (CDN) setup](/setup/content-delivery-network/).

## Vocabulary

<Vocabulary>
### Storefront configuration

The `configs.xlsx` file contains the connection settings for your Commerce blocks. Each row in the file contains a `key` and a `value` that corresponds to a specific setting in your Commerce backend. The `key` is used to retrieve the `value` from the `configs.xlsx` file and is used to connect your Commerce blocks to your Commerce backend.

### default values

By default, the values in the `configs.xlsx` file are from the boilerplate's sample backend to ensure everything works out of the box. But when it comes time to connect your own backend, you need to know what each key means so you can update it with the correct value from your own Commerce instance.

### getConfigValue function

The `getConfigValue` function is a helper function that retrieves the `value` from the `configs.xlsx` file using the `key` as an argument. The `getConfigValue` function is used to connect your Commerce blocks to your Commerce backend.

### Commerce block connection

To connect a Commerce block to your Commerce backend, you'll use the `getConfigValue` function to set the **Services endpoint** and **GraphQL headers** for the block. The **Services endpoint** is the URL for the block's GraphQL endpoint, and the **GraphQL headers** are the headers required to make a request to the endpoint.

</Vocabulary>

## Examples

You can find the `configs.xlsx` file in your content drive by clicking on the mountpoint link in your project's `fstab.yaml` file. You should see the `configs.xlsx` file at the root of the SharePoint directory. Open the file to view the connection **keys** and **values** of the sample backend. They should look similar (but not exact) to the following:

<OptionsTable
  options={[
    ['#', 'Key', 'Value'],
    ['1', 'commerce-endpoint', 'https://catalog-service-sandbox.adobe.io/graphql'],
    ['2', 'commerce-core-endpoint', 'https://mystorefront.com/graphql',],
    ['3', 'commerce-environment-id', '7cb935fd-d3bc-487b-9a2f-e5965c30f2a1'],
    ['4', 'commerce-root-category-id', '2'],
    ['5', 'commerce-website-code', 'base'],
    ['6', 'commerce-store-code', 'main_website_store'],
    ['7', 'commerce-store-view-code', 'default'],
    ['8', 'commerce-customer-group', 'd0b8ea36fca097dc92c02b1d104e6f41099184cb'],
    ['9', 'commerce-x-api-key', 'a6b4e2f69a4a4267a8f423c8caaf6a47'],
  ]}
/>

Each `key` is described below with links to more details. The `value` for each key is specific to your Commerce instance and can be provided by your Commerce administrator.

## Step-by-step

We'll use the `product-details` Commerce block as an example of where and how to updated the connection settings for your Commerce blocks when switching to your own Commerce backend.

<Tasks>

<Task>

### Import the getConfigValue function.

First, import the `getConfigValue` function from your boilerplate's `scripts/configs.js` file. The `getConfigValue` function takes a `string` that matches one of the keys from the `configs.xlsx` file and returns the corresponding value.

```javascript
import { getConfigValue } from '../../scripts/configs.js';
```

</Task>

<Task>

### Set the endpoint and fetch headers.

Within the Commerce block's `decorate` function, use the `getConfigValue` function to set the **Services endpoint** and **GraphQL headers** for the dropin block.

```javascript
export default async function decorate(block) {
  // Initialize Drop-ins
  initializers.register(product.initialize, {});

  // Set Fetch Endpoint (Service)
  product.setEndpoint(await getConfigValue('commerce-endpoint'));

  // Set Fetch Headers (Service)
  product.setFetchGraphQlHeaders({
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Magento-Environment-Id': await getConfigValue('commerce-environment-id'),
    'Magento-Website-Code': await getConfigValue('commerce-website-code'),
    'Magento-Store-View-Code': await getConfigValue('commerce-store-view-code'),
    'Magento-Store-Code': await getConfigValue('commerce-store-code'),
    'Magento-Customer-Group': await getConfigValue('commerce-customer-group'),
    'x-api-key': await getConfigValue('commerce-x-api-key'),
  });

  //more...
}
```

</Task>

</Tasks>

## Summary

That's all it takes to connect a dropin Commerce block to your Commerce backend settings. You'll use the same configuration keys to connect any custom Commerce blocks or new Commerce blocks provided in later releases.
