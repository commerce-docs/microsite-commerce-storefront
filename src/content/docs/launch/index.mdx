Our launch resources are designed specifically to help ensure a smooth and successful lauch of your Commerce + Edge Delivery Services storefront project.

Adobe Commerce projects usually require much more than a simple content delivery network (CDN) switch to launch. Ensure that the launch activities are well defined and planned. You should also consider a rollback plan.

## Documentation

For complete documentation on launching your storefront, visit the [Launch section](https://www.aem.live/docs/#launch) on the Adobe Experience Manager site or select the direct links below. You should also review the Commerce-specific [launch checklist](#launch-checklist).

## Launch checklist

The launch of a new storefront can be an overwhelming and stressful process. If you don't have a checklist, you're likely to forget something.

Tracking all the tasks that need to be completed before the launch of your Adobe Commerce on Edge Delivery Services storefront project is a best practice. This checklist will help you ensure that you have everything in place before you launch.

During the development phase of your project, you'll encounter tasks around migrating implementations that were done on a development or staging environment to production. It is essential to keep track of these changes and make them reproducible on the production environment as part of the launch activities.

:::caution
Avoid scheduling a launch shortly before a weekend. The Adobe engineering team might have limited availability to fix critical issues if they occur.

Start your checklist with the [Go-Live Checklist](https://www.aem.live/docs/go-live-checklist). For Commerce sites, you should prioritize SEO tasks. Additionally, consider the following action items.
  
* Switch to the Catalog Service production endpoint (https://catalog-service.adobe.io/graphql)
  * Ensure a production environment is configured in the Service Connector (will result in a new `environmentId`).
  * Sync the production catalog to the new production environment.
  * Create a new Commerce production API key-pair and use the public key as the `x-api-key` value.
  * Double check category IDs and make sure all category pages have a reference to the correct category.
  * Update `environmentId` and `x-api-key` values in the `.helix/config.xlsx` file.
  * Let the Catalog Service team know about the new production environment and launch date.

* Use the production GraphQL endpoint `yourproject.com/graphql` (needs to be changed in the CDN).
  * Make sure to also use this for all the Sidekick extensions and scripts (e.g. sitemap generation, image importer).

* When using Adobe Commerce Fastly, request a new CDN purge token for Commerce production environment.
  * Update in Sharepoint in the `.helix/config.xlsx` file (`authToken` and `serviceId`).

* Verify/update links for password reset e-mail to match the Edge Delivery Service implementation in the Adobe Commerce Admin.
* Verify the configuration of integrations and payment providers (reCAPTCHA, Adyen, Bazaarvoice).
  * Provide and configure production keys.
  * Verify that the new domains/subdomains are allowlisted and potential backend webhooks are working.

* Add a `robots.txt` file.
  * Block the `/drafts` path on the CDN to prevent any drafts from being publicly accessible on the production URL.
  
* Ensure that the site's Lighthouse score is green; targeting `100` on every page (taking into account previous considerations mentioned on this document).
