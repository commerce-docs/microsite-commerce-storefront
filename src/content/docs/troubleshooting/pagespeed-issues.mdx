Common issues for PageSpeed Insights errors and how to resolve them.

## Status code 404

### If This

You view lots of❗️red exclamation points and a <span style="color:#eb1000">status code of 404</span> for your preview (`.page`) or production (`.live`) storefront URLs.

### Check This

Red dots indicate that the page has not been published or previewed since last edited. The 404 error only happens if you've never published or previewed the page you enter into the PageSpeed Insights text field (which includes your `index` page when you only enter your site's URL). So because you never published the page (using Sidekick), Edge Delivery has not yet added the page to the preview or production CDNs, where PageSpeed Insights (and everyone else on the internet) looks for it. The result is a 404 error.
