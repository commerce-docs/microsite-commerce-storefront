All dropins can be customized in five ways: design tokens, CSS classes, slots, content enrichment, and localization. In this section, you'll learn how to use each approach.

## Design tokens

[Design tokens](/customize/design-tokens/) are the quickest way to customize your storefront. By changing the default token values with your own brand colors, typography, spacing, and shapes, you can make quick, global brand changes to your entire storefront.

## CSS classes

[CSS classes](/customize/style/) provide deeper style changes for dropins than design tokens. Overriding or adding new CSS classes allows you to restyle specific areas of the dropin You'll find best practices for styling here.

## Slots

[Slots](/customize/slots/) provide the deepest level of customization. Slots are built-in extension points in the dropin to add your own UI components and functions. You'll learn how powerful slots can be.

## Content enrichment

[Content enrichment](/customize/enrich/) is similar to adding content with slots. The difference is in scale. Enrichment is an Edge Delivery feature that allows you to add content to entire product categories.

## Localization

[Localization](/customize/localize/) is one of the easiest ways to customize dropins for a region. This topic shows you how to add and use a second language file in your dropins.
