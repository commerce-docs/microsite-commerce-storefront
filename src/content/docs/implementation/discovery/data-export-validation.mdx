Data export synchronizes data between an Adobe Commerce instance and connected storefront services.

Validating the data export is crucial to ensure that the data is correctly synchronized and available for the storefront. You can use the [Data Management Dashboard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/systems/data-transfer/data-dashboard) to monitor the data sync progress for each service.

See the [_SaaS Data Export Guide_](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-merchant-services/saas-data-export/overview) for details and troubleshooting.

Use GraphQL to validate that all products were synchronized and product lookup and search are working. See [GraphQL queries](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/services/graphql/catalog-service/products/) and [Postman sample collection](https://github.com/magento/adobe-commerce-catalog-service) for queries. 

For more complex catalogs, reach out to the Adobe team on Slack to validate that the exported data is correct. This might require you to provide a database dump or direct access. Please also reach out to the Adobe team if you encounter any currently un-supported use cases, so that they can be enabled in the future.
