Compared to [content blocks](https://www.aem.live/developer/block-collection), blocks that enable Adobe Commerce functionality (minicart, product teaser, recommendations) can become quite complex.

Using a frontend framework can help manage the complexity. In the boilerplate, you can find examples of blocks that use a buildless version of [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) and [HTM](https://github.com/developit/htm). You should only use it for blocks that require complex state management with different render states. Otherwise, stick with plain JavaScript.

Use the [existing blocks](/get-started/storefront-structure/) in the Commerce boilerplate as a reference (for example, teaser and product recommendations). If you want to use React, it's possible, but not recommended. React is usually too heavy (size + execution) to achieve perfect Lighthouse scores.
