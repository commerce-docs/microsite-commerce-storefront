Our launch resources are designed specifically to help ensure a smooth and successful lauch of your Commerce + Edge Delivery Services storefront project.

Adobe Commerce projects usually require much more than a simple content delivery network (CDN) switch to launch. Ensure that the launch activities are well defined and planned. You should also consider a rollback plan.

## Documentation

For complete documentation on launching your storefront, visit the [Launch section](https://www.aem.live/docs/#launch) on the Adobe Experience Manager site or select the direct links below. You should also review the Commerce-specific [launch checklist](/implementation/launch/checklist/).
