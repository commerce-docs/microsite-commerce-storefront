This topic introduces you to the CSS classes for each UI component used in the DROPIN_NAME and shows you how to override these classes to customize the dropin's CSS styling to match your brand.

## Big Picture

The quickest way to override DROPIN_NAME CSS is to inspect the DROPIN_NAME UI from your browser's developer tools.

{/* Replace `placeholder.webp` in diagram with an annotated screenshot of the dropin and developer tools open */}

<Diagram caption="Find CSS classes to override.">
  ![Find CSS classes to override](@images/placeholder.webp)
</Diagram>

{/* Use the `Callouts` control to describe the numbered annotations in the screenshot. */}

<Callouts>

1. **Inspect the element** in the UI that you want to customize (right-click on the element and select "Inspect" from the menu).
1. **Identify the CSS class(es)** for the element. We use [BEM naming](https://getbem.com/naming/), which makes it easy to know which component you're changing (and which CSS file to use).
