Full-featured shopping components that turn websites into storefronts. They are not the primitive components, like the Carousels and Galleries used within them. For example, our Product Details, Checkout, and Cart dropins are featured as full pages out of the box to create the entire storefront shopping experience for a website. Our dropins can also support different layouts for different purposes. For example, our MiniCart is simply a Cart with compact layout typical of MiniCarts so that they can be added to Popover or Panel components.

For the purpose of describing slots, you can think of a dropin as a special lego brick with a studded surface on all six sides. Each side of our brick provides a surface (slot) to attach additional bricks (UI components, functions) that extend our special brick (dropin) in multiple directions. Like the sides of our lego brick, a dropin provides multiple slots to make it easy for developers to “snap-on” their own UI components and functions to extend our dropins to meet a multitude of specific needs.
